The `FrenbeeAutomaton component` can animate a [[Frenbee Avatar]] as an automaton (animation state machine) based on a state transition by controlling the [[FrenbeeDocument component]].

> The use of the `FrenbeeAutomaton component` is optional. It is possible to control the animation of a [[Frenbee Avatar]] in a way unique to a specific game, without using the `FrenbeeAutomaton component`.
