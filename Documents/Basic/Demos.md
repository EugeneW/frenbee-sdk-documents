▶ [[Demos]]

---

The Frenbee SDK samples are prepared as a Unity scene file (`.unity`).
In the `Project` window, move to the `Assets/Frenbee/System/Demos` folder. Each child folder contains the following scenes.

# Let's view the demos.

If you are a first time developer, open the scenes and try running them in Play mode.

* Avatar Creation Demo ——— An example of an avatar display and a utility of creating an avatar. You can edit the appearance or create at random. You can also save as a [[Integrated Model]].
* Dance Quartet Demo ——— An example of 4 dancing avatars.
* Analog Runner Demo ——— An example of analog translation and rotation. An example of Decorative Physics (Long hair).
* Swordsman Demo ——— An example of unsheathing and sheathing a sword: Reparenting a bone GameObject in conjunction with [[AutomatonState]]. A example of [[Additional Bones]] (Sword).

# Let's try modifying scenes in the Unity Editor.

When you start a new project, it is recommended that you edit a scene in the Unity Editor that is similar to your project. In the Frenbee SDK, dedicated edit window extensions for editing [[Frenbee Avatar]]s are available. Refer to Feature table in [[Home]].

# To make full-scale use the Frenbee SDK.

If you start feeling that operations in the Unity Editor are insufficient, try writing Unity scripts for new logic to start making full-scale use of the Frenbee SDK. In such a case, you can use [[Frenbee Core]].
