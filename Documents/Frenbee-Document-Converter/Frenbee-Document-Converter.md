* In the [[Frenbee]] system, a [[Frenbee Document]] is the basic file representation.
* In principle, a [[Frenbee Avatar]] moves using [[Frenbee Document]]s.

The Frenbee Document Converter provides the function for mutual conversion (import and export) to and from files of formats different from the [[Frenbee Document]].
This helps create and edit [[Frenbee Document]]s using DCC (Digital Content Creation) or other means via external formats.
The converter is mainly intended to convert the FBX format.

> The [[Frenbee Document Converter]] function supports the creation of custom assets.
> The Frenbee Document Converter may be helpful when creating a unique new model or item asset for a [[Frenbee Avatar]].

> However, the converter is very likely to be affected by the "file format restrictions", "restrictions for the DCC edit functions and import/export functions", and "restrictions for the conversion function itself". Be careful when setting up a workflow.
