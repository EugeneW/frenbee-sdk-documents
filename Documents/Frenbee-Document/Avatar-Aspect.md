▶ [[Frenbee Document]]

---
An Avatar Aspect refers to information used to represent the appearance of a [[Frenbee Avatar]].
Specifically, it is represented by a combination of features (shapes and colors of body parts), clothes, and accessories (change of clothes). The act of creating or updating an Avatar Aspect is called [[Avatar Creation]].

An individual component is represented by an [[Aspect Item]], which is a [[Frenbee Document]].

> In the [[Frenbee Core]], a single avatar aspect is represented by an `AvatarAspect` class. A list of the links to the [[Aspect Item]] documents that make up the aspect is stored in the `Models` property. The format is `List<DocumentLink>`.
