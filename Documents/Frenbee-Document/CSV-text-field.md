Input format used to edit data represented in [[CSV]] using the text fields in the GUI (that of Unity Editor in particular). The level of representation of the CSV text field is limited in comparison with [[CSV]], as described below.

* Only a single-line text fields are supported.
* `,` cannot be used as part of an element.
* A blank character can be used as part of an element.
* When multiple elements are lined up, separate them by `,`. No blank character must be put immediately before or after the comma, unless it is part of an element.
* `,` must always be preceded and followed by an element. Do not put `,` where unnecessary, unless there is the need to represent an empty element.
