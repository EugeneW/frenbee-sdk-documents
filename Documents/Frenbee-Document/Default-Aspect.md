â–¶ [[Frenbee Document]]

---

The Default Aspect means the default appearance of a [[Frenbee Avatar]] for each [[Gender]]. It is used to represent the features and clothes adopted immediately after [[Avatar Creation]] is started newly, that is, the features and clothes that have yet to be edited.

Specifically, the Default Aspect enumerates the [[Aspect Item]]s one by one that meet the conditions of including both `aspect` and `default` of [[Machine Keywords]] and excluding `obsolete` (query representation: {+aspect,+default,-obsolete}) with respect to each part for the specified [[Gender]] among the aspect assets referenced by the current project.
