â–¶ [[Frenbee Document]]

---

Model Integration is to assemble several [[Aspect Item]]s into a single [[Frenbee Avatar]]. It is mainly used for model creation after [[Avatar Creation]].

Body parts, clothes, and accessories that can be selected during [[Avatar Creation]] are managed with [[Aspect Item]]s represented by individual [[Frenbee Document]] files.
These individual [[Aspect Item]]s are called [[Partial Model]]s.
An [[Aspect Item]] created through Model Integration is called an [[Integrated Model]].

Model Integration includes the operation of [[Bone Integration]].
