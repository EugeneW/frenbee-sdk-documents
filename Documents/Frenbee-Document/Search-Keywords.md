Search Keywords are [[CSV]] format information that indicates the keywords to be searched for when a human uses a search function in a system managing a [[Frenbee Document]] set. They are also supplemental keywords to be used when a search query is input or the search result is displayed. It is therefore recommended strongly to use uppercase and lowercase letters correctly in [[Search Keywords]] and express them as appropriate for their usage.

The following matching conditions between search queries and keywords depend on the search system.
* Case insensitive
