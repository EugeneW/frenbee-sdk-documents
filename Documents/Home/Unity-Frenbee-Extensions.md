Unity Frenbee Extensions provides extensions for using Frenbee in Unity 4.x. In other words, they are "Frenbee extensions for Unity." They consist of a set of Unity components for Frenbee and a set of editor windows (Unity Editor window extensions) for such components.

Unity Frenbee Extensions particularly refer to the high-level Frenbee functions for Unity and are distinguished from the low-level class-library API [[Frenbee Core]], which is the foundation of Unity Frenbee Extensions.
