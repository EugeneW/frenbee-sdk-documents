***Frenbee SDK for Unity*** is a tool for developers to build 3D avatar and animations into their games with record time on Unity 4.3 or later. Avatars and animations that have been created with this tool are royalty-free regardless of whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes. You can use as a prebuilt character and as an avatar with dynamic appearance changing.

Today, over 260 avatar items and over 40 animation items are available and much more will be added in the future. Additionally FBX 2013.3 (ASCII) is the supported import/export file format to create custom items.

A future version will provide avatar portability. Avatar-related data will be managed on Fresviiâ€™s server and users will be able to port their own avatars between games you created across all platforms.
