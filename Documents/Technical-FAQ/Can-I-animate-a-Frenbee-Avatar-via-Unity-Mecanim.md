Yes. There are some other methods to animate [[Frenbee Avatar]] though it is not recommended. In these alternative methods, however, some specific functions are unavailable and you may have to solve problems by yourself when they arise.

1. Convert the model or animation of the prebuilt [[Frenbee Avatar]] to a FBX format file.
2. Import the FBX format file into Unity.
3. Animate it using Unity Mecanim.

###Restriction

* The functions such as [[FrenbeeAvatarAspect component]] related to [[FrenbeeDocument component]] are not available because [[FrenbeeDocument component]] is not used in this method.
