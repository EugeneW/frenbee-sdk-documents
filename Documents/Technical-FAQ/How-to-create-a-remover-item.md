You can create a [[Remover]] item of the [[Frenbee Document]] using the following steps.  Assume you want to create a [[Remover]] item for an [[Aspect Item]] in this sample method.

1. Display the folder of the [[Frenbee Repository]] in the `Project` window.
2. Select `Aspect` folder to create a [[Remover]] item of the [[Aspect Item]].
3. Use sub-folders to organize items if you want to make further refinement for the items.  This makes your work easier, such as deletion later, in the creation of prototypes.
3. Create a new [[Frenbee Document]] using the [[How to create a new item with Id]] method.  If you use the existing [[Frenbee Document]], proceed to the next step.
4. Select a [[Frenbee Document]] to be edited and choose from the context menu ☰ `Frenbee`/`Repository`/`Edit Outline` (by right clicking, etc.) to open the [[Outline window]] window. 
5. Edit [[Outline]] in the [[Outline window]] window as described later.
6. Save the edited [[Frenbee Document]] by clicking `Save` button.
7. The saved [[Frenbee Document]] is automatically published in [[Frenbee Paged Assets]] by [[Frenbee Asset Build]].
8. Click the `Reload` button to check the action of the edited item in the [[Aspect window]].  Repeat the step 5 through 8 until the desired result is obtained.

## Edit Outline as Remover

* Enter a meaningful name in the `Name` box. This will be the display name.
* Set [[Machine Keywords]] in [[CSV text field]] format.  It is important to include the `Empty`. [[Machine Keywords]] as keywords for this [[Remover]] so they can be searched from the other [[Folder]]. 
* Set [[Semantics]] in [[CSV text field]] format. This specifies which part (single or multiple) that [[Remover]] removes.
* If necessary, you can import PNG file by clicking the `Import....` button and set [[Thumbnail Image]].

Note - For items not explained here, please refer to the [[Outline window]].
