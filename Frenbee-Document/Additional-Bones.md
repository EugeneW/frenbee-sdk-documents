â–¶ [[Frenbee Document]]

---

The bones provided by the [[Reference Avatar Model]] that the Frenbee model has are called [[Standard Bones]]. Bones that are added to these bones as the game's unique extensions are called Additional Bones.
The additional bone function enables unique extended bone-level representations that are not provided by the official Frenbee model.
