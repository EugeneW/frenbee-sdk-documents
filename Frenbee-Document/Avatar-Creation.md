With a [[Frenbee Avatar]], Avatar Creation refers to the act of changing the features and clothes. The appearance of a [[Frenbee Avatar]] provided by its features and clothes is called an [[Avatar Aspect]].

Specifically, it refers to either of the following operations:

* Select the [[Gender]], and create a new [[Avatar Aspect]] from the [[Default Aspect]] for the selected [[Gender]].
* Change the features and clothes of a created [[Avatar Aspect]].

These are done in the following in-game situations:

* GUI for PC (Player Character) creation and equipment change by the player (user)
* Random generation of NPC (Non Player Character)
