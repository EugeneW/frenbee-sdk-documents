The following explains how to create your own [[Integrated Model]].  There are alternative options to create it in each step but the main procedure is introduced here.

1. Use the [[Reference Avatar Model]] in FBX format or a similar model.
2. Import the [[Frenbee Avatar]] or a custom 3D model using DCC that allows functional components available to the Frenbee Avatar.
3. Edit the imported model.
4. Save the edited model as a file (in FBX, etc.).
5. Convert the file into [[Frenbee Document]] format using a converter such as [[FBX to Frenbee document]].
6. Add the [[Frenbee Document]] to [[Frenbee Paged Assets]] in the [[Assets window]].
7. Use the model added to the [[Frenbee Paged Assets]].
